# Sorting-Algorithms
_______
Javascript examples of the different types of sorting methods typically used on arrays.

## Insertion Sort
1. To demonstrate insertion sort, this algorithm will start off by taking an array beginning at the zero index position.
2. Next, the for loop will check the current numer and compare it to the number one place in front of it.
3. If the number at the zero position belongs in front of the next, then leave it along.
4. If not, then remove the item in the next position and shift the zero position to its new spot.
5. Continue this pattern, moving each item into its appropriate position until the entire array is sorted.
## Merge Sort
